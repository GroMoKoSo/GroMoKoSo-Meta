**TLDR**
- **Access Token** → prove you’re allowed to call an API.
- **Refresh Token** → get a new access token without logging in again.
- **ID Token** → contains profile info about the logged-in user.

## Access Token

- **Purpose:** Used to access your protected APIs or backend services.
- **Contents:** A JWT (JSON Web Token) that contains claims like user ID, roles, and permissions.
- **Lifetime:** Short-lived (often a few minutes to an hour) → reduces risk if stolen.
- **Usage:** Sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header when calling APIs.

## Refresh Token

- **Purpose:** Used to obtain new access tokens without making the user log in again.
- **Contents:** Basically just a secure handle, not meant to carry user info.
- **Lifetime:** Longer than the access token (could be hours or days).
- **Usage:** Exchanged at the Keycloak token endpoint to get fresh access/ID tokens.
- **Important:** Should be kept very secure → usually stored server-side or in an HttpOnly cookie.

## ID Token

- **Purpose:** Identifies the authenticated user to the client (your frontend app).
- **Contents:** A JWT that contains information about the user (claims like name, email, username, etc.).
- **Lifetime:** Usually the same as the access token.
- **Usage:** Not used for API authorization, but for knowing who the user is. For example, showing “Welcome, Alice!” in the UI.
